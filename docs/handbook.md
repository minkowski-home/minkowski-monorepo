# Minkowski Documentation Hub

This handbook replaces the placeholder README and acts as the entry point for
product briefs, architecture notes, and operational runbooks. Link documents
here as they are authored so that new contributors can see what is live instead
of "TBD" copy.

- Product notes live in `docs/product/`.
- Architectural ADRs belong in `docs/architecture/`.
- Runbooks for on-call go inside `docs/runbooks/`.
