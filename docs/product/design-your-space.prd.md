# Design Your Space — Product Requirements (Snapshot)

## Problem Statement
Prospects need a visual way to understand how Minkowski furniture fits in their
homes. The README placeholder hinted at PRDs; this file is the first one.

## Requirements
1. Render curated GLB models in a default room.
2. Allow saving layouts via the FastAPI backend.
3. Keep instrumentation hooks for funnel drop-off analysis.

## Open Questions
- Should AR export be part of v1?
- Does the planner need authentication for early beta testers?
