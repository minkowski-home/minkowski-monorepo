# Employee Platform Frontend

React + Vite shell for the internal employee platform. The actual UI has not been implemented yet.

## Scripts
- `npm install` – install JS dependencies.
- `npm run dev` – stub command that will eventually start Vite alongside the FastAPI backend once they exist.

Configure environment variables via `.env` (copy from `.env.example`).
